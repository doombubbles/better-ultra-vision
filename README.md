# Better Ultravision

## NOTE: This version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0 and MelonLoader >v0.6

This mod makes the x/x/2 Ultravision upgrade for the Super Monkey not give such a pitiful range bonus.

By default, Super Range Upgrade give +10 range, while Ultravision only gives +3 range. This mod improves that to +6 range by default.

All this is changeable in a config, as is the price of Ultravision if you want to change the upgrade cost due to this increased power.

This mod also used to let Ultravision let them shoot through walls, but then Ninja Kiwi added that themselves as a Monkey Knowledge lol.
